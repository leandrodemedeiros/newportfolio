  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    My name is Leandro, Iâ€™m a designer from Brazil. I have solid experience and technical knowledge to help teams create and change products and businesses.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I believe in transformation through design. As a product designer, I learned that technology is all about people.
    Thatâ€™s why I decided to get certified in Product Management (PM3), Digital Marketing (PUC Minas) and Digital Transformation (FGV) to have a complete view of the product life cycle and advance my career to other levels.
